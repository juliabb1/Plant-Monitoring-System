## 🧬 How Data Moves Through the System

- **Sensor Input**  
  - Soil moisture and temperature/humidity data are read by the Arduino every 5 seconds.
  
- **Data Processing & Decision Logic**  
  - The Arduino evaluates whether watering is needed based on moisture thresholds.
  - It listens for user input from the Blynk app or the local website to allow manual watering.

- **Actuation**  
  - If conditions are met (either automatically or manually), the relay module activates the water pump.
  
- **Communication & Visualization**  
  - Sensor readings are sent to Blynk via WiFi for remote monitoring.
  - Users can view live data and toggle the water pump remotely via the Blynk app or local website.
  
- **Website Interface**  
  - The website hosted by the **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** operates independently of the Blynk app, providing an alternative way to monitor and control the system.
  - It offers real-time sensor data, as well as the ability to manually activate the watering system.
  - The site is **responsive**, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Sensor Readings**:  
   - The soil moisture and temperature/humidity sensors are read by the Arduino every 2 seconds to gather up-to-date environmental data.

2. **Automatic Watering**:  
   - If the soil moisture is below the preset threshold, the Arduino activates the **water pump** through the relay module to water the plant.

3. **Manual Watering Control**:  
   - Users can activate the water pump manually via the **Blynk app** or the **local website** by pressing the water button.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**:  
   - Sensor data is continuously sent to **Blynk** for remote monitoring, and the **website** refreshes every 5 seconds to display the latest data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and status.

5. **Watering Status**:  
   - The system stops watering when the soil moisture is above the threshold, ensuring the plant doesn’t overwater.

6. **Local Website Features**:  
   - The local website, hosted by the **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi**, provides a **real-time** view of the environmental data.
   - It is **responsive**, adjusting to different screen sizes, so users can access the monitoring system from any device, including smartphones and desktops.
   - The website offers full control over watering and provides up-to-date data without needing a mobile app.
